# Fantasmo-iOS-SDK

## Overview

Supercharge your app with hyper-accurate positioning using just the camera. The Fantasmo SDK is the gateway to the Camera Positiong System (CPS) which provides 6 Degrees-of-Freedom (position and orientation) localization for mobile devices.

## Installation

### CocoaPods (iOS 11+)

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit https://cocoapods.org/. To integrate Fantasmo SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

   `pod 'FantasmoSDK'`

Your Podfile should also include the line `use_frameworks!` at the top

### Carthage (iOS 8+, OS X 10.9+)

You can use Carthage to install Fantasmo SDK by adding it to your Cartfile:
- Get Carthage by running `brew install carthage`
- Create a Cartfile using https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile in the same directory where your .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace is and add below dependnacy in it. For example:

   `github "fantasmoio/Fantasmo-iOS-SDK" ~> 2.0.0`

- Add Carthage.sh by unzip [Carthage.sh.zip](https://github.com/fantasmoio/Fantasmo-iOS-SDK/files/5754931/Carthage.sh.zip) and place it to same directory where your .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace is.
- Give edit permission to Carthage.sh by `chmod +x Carthage.sh`
- Note: you may need to update the XCode version number inside the Carthage.sh file. It should work out of the box for XCode 12, but for XCode 13 update the follow section:

`... __XCODE__1200__BUILD_ ...`

to

`... __XCODE__1300__BUILD_ ...`

- Carthage is run simply by pasting the following command into Terminal:

   `./Carthage.sh update --platform iOS`
   
- In the **General** tab, scroll down to the bottom where you will see **Linked Frameworks and Libraries**. With the Xcode project window still available, open a Finder window and navigate to the project directory. In the project directory, open the following folders: **Carthage/Build/iOS**. In the iOS folder, you should see **FantasmoSDK.framework**. Drag the framework into the **Linked Frameworks and Libraries** section of project and select **Do Not Embed** under Embed option. 

- On your application targetsâ€™ Build Phases settings tab, click the + icon and choose New Run Script Phase. Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (ex: /bin/sh), add the following contents to the script area below the shell:
   
   `/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks`
   
- Add below files in **Input Files** of above Run Script:   
   `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/FantasmoSDK.framework`   
   
- Add below files in **Output Files**:   
   `$(DERIVED_FILE_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/FantasmoSDK.framework`

### Importing

In the near term, the Fantasmo SDK will be provided as a Cocoapod. In the meantime,
the Fantasmo SDK directory can be imported directly into a project.

### Access Tokens

Add your access token to your app's `Info.plist`.
```xml
<key>FM_ACCESS_TOKEN</key>
<string>a0fc7aa1e1144f1e81eaa2ad47794a9e</string>
```

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 11.0+

## Functionality

Camera-based localization is the process of determining the global position of the device camera from an image. Image frames are acquired from an active `ARSession` and sent to a server for computation. The server computation time is approximately 900 ms. The full round trip time is then dictated by latency of the connection.

Since the camera will likely move after the moment at which the image frame is captured, it is necessary to track the motion of the device continuously during localizaiton to determine the position of the device at the time of response. Tracking is provided by `ARSession`. Conventiently, it is then possible to determine the global position of the device at any point in the tracking session regardless of when the image was captured (though you may incur some drift after excessive motion).

## Usage

### Quick Start 

Check out the `FantasmoSDKParkingExample` target or implement the code below. 

```swift
import UIKit
import FantasmoSDK

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
            
    // construct a new parking view with a sessionId
    let sessionId = UUID().uuidString
    let parkingViewController = FMParkingViewController(sessionId: sessionId)

    // configure delegation
    parkingViewController.delegate = self

    // present modally to start
    parkingViewController.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
    self.present(parkingViewController, animated: true)
}
```

### Checking Availability

Before attempting to park and localize with Fantasmo SDK, you should first check if parking is available in the user's current location. You can do this with the static method `FMParkingViewController.isParkingAvailable(near:)` and passing a `CLLocation`. The result block is called with a boolean indicating whether or not the user is near a mapped parking space.

```swift
FMParkingViewController.isParkingAvailable(near: userLocation) { isParkingAvailable in
    if !isParkingAvailable {
        print("No mapped parking spaces nearby.")
        return
    }
    // Create and present a FMParkingViewController here
}
```

### Providing a `sessionId`

The `sessionId` parameter allows you to associate localization results with your own session identifier. Typically this would be a UUID string, but it can also follow your own format. For example, a scooter parking session might take multiple localization attempts. For analytics and billing purposes, this identifier allows you to link multiple attempts with a single parking session.

### Providing Location Updates

By default, during localization the `FMParkingViewController` uses a `CLLocationManager` internally to get automatic updates to the device's location. If you would like to provide your own `CLLocation` updates, you can set the `usesInternalLocationManager` property to `false` and manually call `updateLocation(_ location: CLLocation)` with each update to the location.

```swift
let parkingViewController = FMParkingViewController(sessionId: sessionId)
// disables the internal CLLocationManager
parkingViewController.usesInternalLocationManager = false
self.present(parkingViewController, animated: true)

// create your own CLLocationManager
let myLocationManager = CLLocationManager()
myLocationManager.delegate = self
myLocationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization()
myLocationManager.startUpdatingLocation()

extension ViewController: CLLocationManagerDelegate {
    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
        // notify the parking view controller of the update
        parkingViewController.updateLocation(locations.last)
    }
}
```

If the SDK does not receive valid `CLLocation` updates either from the internal `CLLocationManager` or manually via `updateLocation(_ location: CLLocation)`, then you will receive a localization error.

```swift
func parkingViewController(_ parkingViewController: FMParkingViewController,
                               didReceiveLocalizationError error: FMError, errorMetadata: Any?) {
    if (error.type as? FMLocationError) == FMLocationError.invalidCoordinate {
        print("No location updates received.")
    }
}
```

If this occurs you should check that you're correctly providing the location updates, or if you're using the internal location manager, that the user has given permission to access the device's location.

### QR Codes

Scanning a QR code is the first and only step before localizing. Because we are trying to localize a vehicle and not the device itself, we need a way to determine the vehicle's position relative to the device. This is accomplished by setting an anchor in the ARSession and it's done automatically when the user scans a QR code. The SDK doesn't care about the contents of the QR code and by default will start localizing after any QR code is detected. If your app _does_ care about the contents of the QR code, they can be validated by implementing the the `FMParkingViewControllerDelegate` method:

```swift
func parkingViewController(_ parkingViewController: FMParkingViewController, didScanQRCode qrCode: CIQRCodeFeature, continueBlock: @escaping ((Bool) -> Void)) {
    // Validate the QR code
    let isValidCode = qrCode.messageString != nil
    
    // Call the continue block with the result
    continueBlock(isValidCode)
    
    // Validation can also be done asynchronously.
    APIService.validateQRCode(qrCode) { isValidCode in
        continueBlock(isValidCode)
    }
}
```

**Important:** If you implement this method, you must call the `continueBlock` with a boolean value. A value of `true` indicates the QR code is valid and that localization should start. Passing `false` to this block indicates the code is invalid and instructs the parking view to scan for more QR codes. This block may be called synchronously or asynchronously but must be done so on the main queue.

### Localizing 

During localization, frames are continuously captured and sent to the server. Filtering logic in the SDK will automatically select the best frames, and it will issue behavior requests to the user to help improve the incoming images. Confidence in the location result increases during successive updates and clients can choose to stop localizing by dismissing the view, when a desired confidence level is reached.

```swift
func parkingViewController(_ parkingViewController: FMParkingViewController,
                           didReceiveLocalizationResult result: FMLocationResult) {
    // Got a localization result
    if result.confidence == .low {
        return
    }
    let coordinate = result.location.coordinate
    print("Coordinate: \(coordinate.latitude), \(coordinate.longitude)")
    // Medium or high confidence, dismiss to stop localizing
    parkingViewController.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

Localization errors may occur but the localization process will not stop and it is still possible to get a successful localization result. You should decide on an acceptable threshold for errors and only stop localizing when it is reached, again by dismissing the view.

```swift
func parkingViewController(_ parkingViewController: FMParkingViewController,
                           didReceiveLocalizationError error: FMError, errorMetadata: Any?) {
    // Got a localization error
    errorCount += 1
    if errorCount < 5 {
        return
    }
    // Too many errors, dismiss to stop localizing
    parkingViewController.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

### Customizing UI

The UI for both scanning QR codes and localizing can be completely customized by creating your own implementations of the view protocols.

```swift
public protocol FMQRScanningViewControllerProtocol: UIViewController {
    func didStartQRScanning()
    func didStopQRScanning()
    func didScanQRCode(_ qrCode: CIQRCodeFeature)
}

public protocol FMLocalizingViewControllerProtocol: UIViewController {
    func didStartLocalizing()
    func didRequestLocalizationBehavior(_ behavior: FMBehaviorRequest)
    func didReceiveLocalizationResult(_ result: FMLocationResult)
    func didReceiveLocalizationError(_ error: FMError, errorMetadata: Any?)
}
```

Once you've created view controllers for the above protocols, simply register them with your `FMParkingViewController` instance before presenting it.

```swift
parkingViewController.registerQRScanningViewController(MyCustomQRScanningViewController.self)
parkingViewController.registerLocalizingViewController(MyCustomLocalizingViewController.self)
```

### Behavior Requests

To help the user localize successfully and to maximize the result quality, camera input is filtered against common problems and behavior requests are displayed to the user. These are messages explaining what the user should be doing with their device in order to localize properly. For example, if the users device is aimed at the ground, you may receive a `"Tilt your device up"` request. 

If you're using the default localization UI, these requests are already displayed to the user. If you've registered your own custom UI, you should use the `didRequestLocalizationBehavior(_ behavior: FMBehaviorRequest)` method of `FMLocalizingViewControllerProtocol` to display these requests to users. 

```swift
class MyCustomLocalizingViewController: UIViewController, FMLocalizingViewControllerProtocol {
  
    @IBOutlet var label: UILabel!
  
    func didRequestLocalizationBehavior(_ behavior: FMBehaviorRequest) {
        // display the requested behavior to the user
        label.text = behavior.description
    }
}
```

As of right now behavior requests are only available in English. More languages coming soon.

### Testing and Debugging 

Since it's not always possible to be onsite for testing, a simulation mode is provided to make test localization queries.

```swift
parkingViewController.isSimulation = true
```

And for debugging, it's sometimes useful to show the statistics view to see what's happening under the hood.

```swift
parkingViewController.showsStatistics = showsStatisticsSwitch.isOn
```

### Logging

By default only errors and warnings are logged, but other verbosity levels are available: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, and `error`.

```swift
parkingViewController.logLevel = .debug
```

You may also intercept logging calls to send log messages to your own analytics services.

```swift
parkingViewController.logIntercept = { message in
    sendToAnalytics(message)
}
```

### Overrides

For testing, the device location can be specified in the Info.plist.

    key: FM_GPS_LAT_LONG
    value: 25.762586765198417,-80.19404801110545

For _internal development_ testing and demo builds, the API server URL can be specified in the Info.plist. It should _not_ include the URI scheme.

    key: FM_API_BASE_URL
    value: 192:168:0:1:8090/v1/image.localize

## Testing

### Running Tests

To run unit tests from the command line use the following command:

`xcodebuild test -project FantasmoSDK.xcodeproj -scheme FantasmoSDKTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=latest,name=iPhone 12 Pro Max'`

If you would like to see the neatly formatted version that appears in the GitHub actions log pipe the output into xcpretty (you will need to install xcpretty separately):

`xcodebuild test -project FantasmoSDK.xcodeproj -scheme FantasmoSDKTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=latest,name=iPhone 12 Pro Max' | xcpretty`

You can specify multiple target OS and device names to run against if so desired.
